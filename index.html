      <p>I have been training in Okinawan Shorin Ryu for the past twenty years, <br> and I
       have decided that sharing my knowledge by teaching others is the best use <br> of
        my life. The things I've learned about myself, others, and being a human <br>
         being has been of inestimable value to me, and I want to share that <br>
          knowledge and awareness with others.</p></td>

    <h3>Dojo History</h3>
      <p>
        I started my martial arts journey at Gabriele's Karate in Groton, CT in
        May of 2001, where after two years of training, I was invited to become
        a student teacher. I stayed on teaching and training until shortly after
        my second degree black belt test in December of 2007. From there, I
        found my current teacher, Renshi Cliff Cochran of Shorin Ryu Karate of
        Connecticut, formerly East Coast Karate, in Norwich, CT. He taught and
        mentored me until I was able to open Warrior's Path Karate in December
        of 2016. He remains my teacher and mentor to this day.
